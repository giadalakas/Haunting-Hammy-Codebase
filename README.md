# Haunting-Hammy-Codebase

Welcome to the codebase repository for Haunting Hammy – an immersive adventure game that plunges players into the chilling mansion of Ravenwood Hollow.

## Project Description
Oh no! Your pet hamster, Hammy, has stumbled into the chilling mansion of Ravenwood Hollow; it’s up to you, Lucy, to embark on a thrilling adventure through the haunted residence to rescue him. Navigate through spooky settings, avoid haunted creatures, and defeat any ghouls standing between you and Hammy’s way. Can you conquer the supernatural challenges within the mansion's dark corridors and rescue Hammy before midnight?

## What I Did
As the lead programmer and level designer for the project, my contributions include:
- Implemented camera movement functionality.
- Developed player movement functionality.
- Created a custom physics property to fine-tune player movement by removing friction and allow for smoother platforming.
- Imported and configured tilesets for level design.
- Implemented patrolling and stationary enemy functionality.
- Programmed hitting an enemy to restart the player from the initial position.
- Implemented collectible functionality and UI display.
- Created initial level design and continued to iterate upon it.
- Fine-tuned level design by using tilesets to build out house background and replace white-box with custom platforms.
- Designed the final boss fight mechanics:
  - Player can throw collected potions at the boss.
  - Leveraged singleton design pattern to manage player potions and update UI accordingly.
  - Boss tracks player position and fires goo at it.
  - Boss turns red and takes damage from player potions.
- Implemented health system functionality and UI hearts.
- Added checkpoints to level 1.
- Finalized tileset design for level 1.
- Implemented possessed item functionality (moving platform).
- Added all necessary components into level 2 (i.e., enemies, collectibles, etc.).
- Worked on Level 2 design: initial whiteboxing, iterating on design, and adding final tilesets (still in progress).
- Implemented Level 2 timer.
- Fixed bugs and implemented sounds.
- Designed paintings around the mansion.

## Process Overview
Our journey from concept to the final project was marked by collaboration, iteration, and a shared passion for bringing our ideas to life. As the lead programmer and level designer, I had the privilege of witnessing the evolution of Haunting Hammy firsthand. Our team dynamic played a crucial role in our success, fostering creativity, innovation, and camaraderie.

### Starting Point: Conceptualization
Our journey began with a spark of inspiration – the idea of a thrilling adventure game set in the eerie mansion of Ravenwood Hollow. With this concept in mind, we embarked on a collaborative brainstorming session, fleshing out the game mechanics, storyline, and visual aesthetics. Each team member brought their unique perspectives and skills to the table, contributing to the vast array of ideas that would shape our project.

### Iterative Development: From D1 to D2
As development progressed, we transitioned from concept to implementation, moving through iterative stages marked by continuous improvement and refinement. From D1 to D2, we embraced feedback, iterated on gameplay mechanics, and fine-tuned level designs to enhance player experience.

### Streamlining Code and Continuous Improvement
As the lead programmer, I took pride in overseeing the technical aspects of the project, constantly seeking ways to improve efficiency and streamline code. Working closely with the rest of the team, I implemented optimizations, refactored code, and resolved bugs to ensure a smooth and immersive gameplay experience. Our collaborative approach to development enabled us to overcome challenges, adapt to changes, and ultimately, deliver a polished final project.

### Team Collaboration and Progress Photos
Throughout the development process, collaboration was key. Regular team meetings and brainstorming sessions facilitated our alignment, ensuring that everyone was on the same page. These progress photos serve as visual milestones, documenting our journey and highlighting the progress we have made. Reflecting on these photos, it's remarkable to see how far we've come and how our collective efforts have shaped the final product.
