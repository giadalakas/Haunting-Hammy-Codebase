# Haunting-Hammy-Codebase

Welcome to the codebase repository for Haunting Hammy – an immersive adventure game that plunges players into the chilling mansion of Ravenwood Hollow.

## Project Description
Oh no! Your pet hamster, Hammy, has stumbled into the chilling mansion of Ravenwood Hollow; it’s up to you, Lucy, to embark on a thrilling adventure through the haunted residence to rescue him. Navigate through spooky settings, avoid haunted creatures, and defeat any ghouls standing between you and Hammy’s way. Can you conquer the supernatural challenges within the mansion's dark corridors and rescue Hammy before midnight?
